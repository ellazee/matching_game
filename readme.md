#Memory Matching Game

This is a memory matching game, where the players can flip cards in an attempt to make a match. The player with the most matches wins the game. Jquery was used, including a flip plug-in. The Javscript includes the Fisher Yates shuffle algorithm to randomize the cards, and sweet alerts were used for match and win notifications.  

######FEATURES
* Tracking of which player's turn it is
* A scoreboard that shows the current score
* Notifications for when there is a match, and when the game is finished

######BUGS TO WORK OUT
* The game is not optimized for smaller screens, ie smart phones etc.
* If the player clicks on a card before the previous card is finished flipping, it causes the game to get out of order.
